Project Name: Smart Contract to Mint and Burn Tokens

Description: This project is a simple implementation of Ethereum smart contract that creates a token called "NamanKunarSinha" with symbol "N", abbreviated as "NKS". This smart contract is written in Solidity and is designed to manage the minting and burning of tokens. The abbreviation of the storage symbol is set to "NKS". The default setting is 0. It uses addresses as keys and uints as values ​​to store balances. It must have two parameters:

addr: The address where new tokens will be allocated. BURN function

The BurnToken function is used to destroy the address's tokens, reducing the address's total supply and balance. It must also have two parameters:

addr: the address where the token will be destroyed.
